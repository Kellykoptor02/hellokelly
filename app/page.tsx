      <p className="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        I bring a unique blend of legal operations and tech-forward consulting experienceâ€”rooted in years working
        with law firms and evolving into a consulting role with a focus on client success, administration,
        and document management. Whether Iâ€™m streamlining backend systems, writing clear technical documentation,
        or building solutions that keep teams aligned, Iâ€™m driven by a love of organized systems and excellent service.

      <p className="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        Currently, I consult with Pueo Business Solutions in the Washington DC area, where I help organizations improve
        how they manage information and serve their clients. Previously, I was the Director of Administration and Client
        Happiness at Great Legal Marketing, where I combined operations leadership with a deep focus on user and customer experience.

      <p className="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        Outside of work, Iâ€™m a Brevard College graduate, former student-athlete (soccer & lacrosse), and an Alpha Pi Sigma & SAAC leader.
